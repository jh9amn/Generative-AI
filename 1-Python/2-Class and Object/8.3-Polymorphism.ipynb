    "Polymorphism is a **core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** that allows objects of **different classes** to be treated as objects of a **common superclass**.  \n",

    "### ðŸ”‘ Key Points\n",
    "- âœ¨ It enables a **single action** to be performed in **different forms**.  \n",
    "- ðŸ”„ Achieved mainly through **method overriding** (same method, different behavior).  \n",
    "- ðŸ§© Also supported via **interfaces / abstract classes** in many languages.  \n",
