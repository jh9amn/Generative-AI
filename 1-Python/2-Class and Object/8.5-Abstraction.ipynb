    "#### ```Abstraction:```\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the **four pillars of OOP**.  \n",
    "It refers to the process of **hiding implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: **\"What an object does, rather than how it does it.\"**\n",

    "#### ðŸ”‘ ```Key Points```\n",
    "- Abstraction focuses on **hiding the internal implementation** and exposing only necessary functionality.\n",
    "- Achieved using:\n",
    "  - **Abstract classes**\n",
    "  - **Interfaces**\n",
    "- Promotes **loose coupling** and improves **code reusability**.\n",
    "- Increases **security** by only exposing relevant operations.\n",
